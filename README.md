# After a Dreary Winter
**Description:** Crocus flowers can grow in snow and symbolize resilience during hardship and the promise of a new beginning. The player interacts with the game by placing a crocus flower on an ice, snow or grass tile. Different choices in placing the flower on tiles bring the player different meanings of the crocus flower.

**Artist statement:** This simulator supports the messages I want to leave to the player. The only difficulty I have with the tools is the vertex calculation to draw objects and vertex.
